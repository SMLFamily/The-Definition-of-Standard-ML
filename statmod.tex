\label{statmod-sec}
\subsection{Semantic Objects}
\label{statmod-sem-obj-sec}
The\index{34.1} simple 
objects for Modules static semantics are exactly as for the Core.
The compound objects are those for the Core,
augmented by those in Figure~\ref{module-objects}.

%
The prefix $(\N)$, in signatures and functor signatures, binds both type names
and structure names. We shall always consider a set $\N$ of names as
partitioned into a pair $(\M,\T)$ of sets of the two kinds of name.

It is sometimes convenient to work with an arbitrary semantic object $A$, or
assembly $A$ of such objects.
As with the function $\TyNamesFcn$,
$\StrNamesFcn(A)$ and $\NamesFcn(A)$ denote respectively the set of structure names
and the set of names occurring free in $A$.

%We shall often need to change bound names in semantic objects.
%For example, we sometimes require that
%$\N\cap\N'=\emptyset$ in a functor signature.  More generally,
%for arbitrary $A$
%it is sometimes convenient to assume that {\sl all}
%nameset prefixes $\N$ occurring in $A$ are disjoint.  In that
%case we say that we are {\sl disjoining bound names} in $A$.

Certain operations require a change of bound names in semantic objects;
see for example Section~\ref{realisation-sec}. When bound type names are
changed, we demand that all of their attributes (i.e. imperative, equality
and arity) are preserved.\index{34.2}

For any structure $\S=\longS{}$ we call $m$ the {\sl structure name} or
{\sl name} of $\S$; also, the {\sl proper substructures} of $\S$ are
the members of $\Ran\SE$ and their proper substructures.  The 
{\sl substructures} of
$\S$ are $\S$ itself and its proper substructures.  The structures
{\sl occurring in}
an object or assembly $A$ are the structures and
substructures from which it is built.

The operations of projection, injection and modification are as for the
Core. Moreover, we define $\of{\C}{\B}$ to be the context
$(\of{\T}{\B},\emptyset,\of{\E}{\B})$, i.e.~with an empty set of
explicit type variables.
Also,
we frequently need to modify a basis $\B$ by an environment $\E$
(or a structure environment $\SE$ say),
at the same time extending $\of{\N}{\B}$ to include the type names and
structure names of $\E$ (or of $\SE$ say).
We therefore define $\B\oplus\SE$, for example, to mean
$\B+(\NamesFcn\SE,\SE)$.\index{34.3}

\subsection{Consistency}
\label{consistency-sec}
A\index{35.1} set of type structures is said to be {\sl consistent} if, for all
$(\theta_1,\CE_1)$ and $(\theta_2,\CE_2)$ in the set, if $\theta_1 = \theta_2$
then
\[\CE_1=\emptymap\ {\rm or}\ \CE_2=\emptymap\ {\rm or}\ \Dom\CE_1=\Dom\CE_2\]
A semantic object $A$ or assembly $A$ of objects is said to be
{\sl consistent} if (after changing bound names to make all nameset prefixes
in $A$ disjoint) for all $\S_1$ and
$\S_2$ occurring in $A$ and for every $\longstrid$ and every $\longtycon$
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\of{\m}{\S_1}=\of{\m}{\S_2}$, and both
      $\S_1(\longstrid)$ and $\S_2(\longstrid)$ exist, then
      \[ \of{\m}{\S_1(\longstrid)}\ =\ \of{\m}{\S_2(\longstrid)}\]
\item If $\of{\m}{\S_1}=\of{\m}{\S_2}$, and both
      $\S_1(\longtycon)$ and $\S_2(\longtycon)$ exist, then
      \[ \of{\theta}{\S_1(\longtycon)}\ =\ \of{\theta}{\S_2(\longtycon)}\]
\item The set of all type structures in $A$ is consistent
\end{enumerate}

As an example, a functor signature $\longfunsig{}$ is
consistent if, assuming first that $\N\cap\N'=\emptyset$,
the assembly $A=\{\S,\S'\}$ is consistent.

We may loosely say that two structures $\S_1$ and $\S_2$ are consistent if
$\{\S_1,\S_2\}$ is consistent, but must remember that this is stronger than
the assertion that $\S_1$ is consistent and $\S_2$ is consistent.

Note that if $A$ is a consistent assembly and $A'\subset A$ then $A'$ is
also a consistent assembly.

\subsection{Well-formedness}
A signature\index{35.2} $\longsig{}$ is {\sl well-formed} 
if $\N\subseteq\NamesFcn\S$,
and also, whenever $(\m,\E)$ is a
substructure of $\S$ and $\m\notin\N$, then $\N\cap(\NamesFcn\E)=\emptyset$.
A functor signature $\longfunsig{}$ is {\sl well-formed} if
$\longsig{}$ and  $(\N')\S'$ are well-formed, and also, whenever
$(\m',\E')$ is a substructure of $\S'$ and $\m'\notin\N\cup\N'$,
then $(\N\cup\N')\cap(\NamesFcn\E')=\emptyset$.

An object or assembly $A$ is {\sl well-formed} if every type environment,
signature and functor signature occurring in $A$ is well-formed.

\subsection{Cycle-freedom}
An\index{35.3} object or assembly $A$ is {\sl cycle-free} if it contains no
cycle of structure names; that is, there is no sequence
\[\m_0,\cdots,\m_{k-1},\m_k=m_0\ \ (k>0)\]
of structure names such that, for each $i\ (0\leq i<k)$ some structure
with name $m_i$ occurring in $A$ has a proper substructure with name
$m_{i+1}$.

\subsection{Admissibility}
\label{admis-sec}
An\index{36.1} object or assembly $A$ is {\sl admissible} if it is
consistent, well-formed and cycle-free.  Henceforth it is assumed that
all objects mentioned are admissible.  We also require that
\begin{enumerate}
\item In every sentence $A\ts\phrase\ra A'$  inferred by the rules
given in Section~\ref{statmod-rules-sec}, the assembly $\{A,A'\}$ is
admissible.  
\item In the special case of a sentence $\B\ts\sigexp\ra\S$,
we further require that the assembly consisting of all semantic
objects occurring in the entire inference of this sentence be
admissible. This  is important for the definition of principal
signatures in Section~\ref{prinsig-sec}.
\end{enumerate}
In our semantic definition we have not undertaken to
indicate how admissibility should be checked in an implementation.
 
\subsection{Type Realisation}
%
A {\sl type realisation}\index{36.2} is a map
$\tyrea:\TyNames\to\TypeFcn$
such that
$\t$ and $\tyrea(\t)$ have the same arity, and
if $t$ admits equality then so does $\tyrea(\t)$.

The {\sl support} $\Supp\tyrea$ of a type realisation $\tyrea$ is the set of
type names $\t$ for which $\tyrea(\t)\ne\t$.
%
\subsection{Realisation}
\label{realisation-sec}
A {\sl realisation}\index{36.3} is a function $\rea$ of names,
partitioned into a type realisation $\tyrea:\TyNames\to\TypeFcn$
and a function $\strrea : \StrNames\to\StrNames$.
The {\sl support} $\Supp\rea$
of a realisation $\rea$ is the set of
names $\n$ for which $\rea(\n)\ne\n$.
The {\sl yield} $\Yield\rea$ of a realisation $\rea$ is the set of
names which occur in some $\rea(\n)$ for which $\n\in\Supp\rea$.

Realisations $\rea$ are extended to apply to all semantic objects; their
effect is to
replace each name $n$ by $\rea(\n)$.  In applying $\rea$ to an object with
bound names, such as a signature $\longsig{}$, first bound names must be
changed so that, for each binding prefix $(\N)$,
\[\N\cap(\Supp\rea\cup\Yield\rea)=\emptyset\ .\]
%
\subsection{Type Explication}
\label{type-explication-sec}
A\index{36.35} signature $(\N)\S$ is {\sl type-explicit\/} if,
whenever $\t\in\N$ and occurs free in $\S$, then some substructure of
$\S$ contains a type environment $\TE$ such that
$\TE(\tycon)=(\t,\CE)$ for some $\tycon$ and some $\CE$.  
%
\subsection{Signature Instantiation}
A\index{36.4} structure $\S_2$ {\sl is an instance of} a signature
$\sig_1=\longsig{1}$,
written $\siginst{\sig_1}{}{\S_2}$, if there exists a realisation
$\rea$
such that $\rea(\S_1)=\S_2$ and $\Supp\rea\subseteq\N_1$.
(Note that if $\sig_1$ is type-explicit then there is at most one
such $\rea$.)\ 
A signature
$\sig_2=\longsig{2}$ {\sl is an instance of}
$\sig_1 =\longsig{1}$,
written $\siginst{\sig_1}{}{\sig_2}$, if
$\siginst{\sig_1}{}{\S_2}$ and $\N_2\cap(\NamesFcn\sig_1)=\emptyset$.
It can be shown that $\siginst{\sig_1}{}{\sig_2}$ iff, for all $\S$,
whenever $\siginst{\sig_2}{}{\S}$ then $\siginst{\sig_1}{}{\S}$.

\subsection{Functor Signature Instantiation}
A\index{36.5} pair $(\S,(\N')\S')$ is called a {\sl functor instance}.
Given $\funsig=\longfunsig{1}$,
a functor instance $(\S_2,(\N_2')\S_2')$ is an {\sl instance} of
$\funsig$,
written $\funsiginst{\funsig}{}{(\S_2,(\N_2')\S_2')}$,
if there exists a realisation $\rea$
such that
$\rea(\S_1,(\N_1')\S_1')=(\S_2,(\N_2')\S_2')$ and
$\Supp\rea\subseteq\N_1$.
%
\subsection{Enrichment}
\label{enrichment-sec}
In\index{37.1} matching a structure to a signature, the structure will be allowed both to
have more components, and to be more polymorphic, than (an instance of) the
signature.  Precisely, we  define enrichment of structures, environments and
type structures by mutual recursion as follows.

A structure $\S_1=(\m_1,\E_1)$
{\sl enriches} another structure
$\S_2=(\m_2,\E_2)$, written $\S_1\succ\S_2$, if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\m_1=\m_2$
\item $\E_1\succ\E_2$
\end{enumerate}
An environment $\E_1=\longE{1}$
{\sl enriches} another environment $\E_2=$ $\longE{2}$,
written $\E_1\succ\E_2$,
if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Dom\SE_1\supseteq\Dom\SE_2$, and $\SE_1(\strid)\succ\SE_2(\strid)$
                                               for all $\strid\in\Dom\SE_2$
\item $\Dom\TE_1\supseteq\Dom\TE_2$, and $\TE_1(\tycon)\succ\TE_2(\tycon)$
                                               for all $\tycon\in\Dom\TE_2$
\item $\Dom\VE_1\supseteq\Dom\VE_2$, and $\VE_1(\id)\succ\VE_2(\id)$
                                               for all $\id\in\Dom\VE_2$
\item $\Dom\EE_1\supseteq\Dom\EE_2$, and $\EE_1(\exn)=\EE_2(\exn)$
                                               for all $\exn\in\Dom\EE_2$
\end{enumerate}
Finally, a type structure $(\theta_1,\CE_1)$
{\sl enriches} another type structure $(\theta_2,\CE_2)$,
written $(\theta_1,\CE_1)\succ(\theta_2,\CE_2)$,
if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\theta_1=\theta_2$
\item Either $\CE_1=\CE_2$ or $\CE_2=\emptymap$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Signature Matching}
\label{sigmatch-sec}
A\index{37.2} structure $\S$ {\sl matches} a signature $\sig_1$ if there exists
a structure $\S^-$ such that $\sig_1\geq\S^-\prec\S$. Thus matching
is a combination of instantiation and enrichment. There is at most
one such $\S^-$, given $\sig_1$ and $\S$. Moreover, writing $\sig_1=
\longsig{1}$, if $\sig_1\geq\S^-$ then there exists a realisation $\rea$
with $\Supp\rea\subseteq\N_1$ and $\rea(\S_1)=\S^-$.
We shall then say that $\S$ matches $\sig_1$ {\em via} $\rea$.
(Note that if $\sig_1$ is type-explicit 
then $\rea$ is uniquely determined by $\sig_1$ and $\S$.)

A\index{37.2.5} signature $\sig_2$ {\em matches} a signature $\sig_1$
if for all structures $\S$, if $\S$ matches $\sig_2$ then $\S$
matches $\sig_1$. It can be shown that $\sig_2=\longsig{2}$ matches
$\sig_1=\longsig{1}$ if and only if there exists a realisation
$\rea$ with $\Supp\rea\subseteq\N_1$ and $\rea(\S_1)\prec\S_2$
and $\N_2\cap\NamesFcn\sig_1=\emptyset$.

\subsection{Principal Signatures}
\label{prinsig-sec}
The definitions in this section concern the elaboration of signature
expressions; more precisely they concern inferences of sentences of the
form $\B\ts\sigexp\ra\S$, where $\S$ is a structure and $\B$ is a basis.
Recall, from Section~\ref{admis-sec}, that the assembly of all semantic
objects in such an inference must be admissible.

For any basis $\B$ and any structure $\S$, 
we say that $\B$ {\sl covers} $\S$
if for every substructure $(m,E)$ of $\S$ such that
$m\in\of{\N}{\B}$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
For every structure identifier $\strid\in\Dom\E$,
$\B$ contains a substructure $(m,\E')$ with $m$
free and $\strid\in\Dom\E'$
\item
For every type constructor $\tycon\in\Dom\E$,
$\B$ contains a substructure $(m,\E')$ with $m$ free
and $\tycon\in\Dom\E'$
\end{enumerate}
(This condition is not a consequence of consistency of $\{\B,\S\}$; 
informally, it states that if $\S$ shares a substructure with $\B$,
then $\S$ mentions no more components of the substructure than
$\B$ does.)



We\index{38.1} say that a signature
$\longsig{}$ is {\sl principal for $\sigexp$ in $\B$} if, choosing $\N$
so that $(\of{\N}{\B})\cap\N=\emptyset$,
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\B$ covers $\S$ 
\item $\B\vdash\sigexp\ra\S$
\item Whenever $\B\vdash\sigexp\ra\S'$, then $\sigord{\longsig{}}{}{\S'}$
\end{enumerate}
We claim that if $\sigexp$ elaborates in $\B$ to some structure covered
by $\B$, then it possesses a principal signature in $\B$.

Analogous to the definition given for type environments in
Section~\ref{typeenv-wf-sec}, we say that a semantic object $A$
{\sl respects equality} if every type environment occurring in 
$A$ respects equality. 
%
%
%Further, let $T$ be the set of type names
%$\t$ such that $(\t,\CE)$ occurs in $A$ for some
%$\CE\neq\emptymap$.  Then $A$ is said to {\sl maximise equality}
%if (a) $A$ respects equality, and also (b) if any larger subset of
%$T$ were to admit equality (without any change in the equality
%attribute of any type names not in $T$) then $A$ would cease to
%respect equality.
%

Now\index{38.5} let us assume that $\sigexp$ possesses a principal signature
$\sig_0=\longsig{0}$ in $B$. We wish to
define, in terms of $\sig_0$, another signature $\sig$ which provides more
information about the equality attributes of structures which will
match $\sig_0$. To this end, let $\T_0$ be the set of type names $\t\in\N_0$
which do not admit equality, and such that $(\t,\CE)$ occurs in $\S_0$
for some $\CE\neq\emptymap$.  Then we say $\sig$ is 
{\sl equality-principal for $\sigexp$ in $\B$} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$\sig$ respects equality
\item
$\sig$ is obtained from $\sig_0$ just by making as many
members of $\T_0$ admit equality as possible, subject to 1.~above
\end{enumerate}
It is easy to show that, if any such $\sig$ exists, it is determined
uniquely by $\sig_0$; moreover, $\sig$ exists if $\sig_0$ itself
respects equality.

%                   Inference Rules
%
\subsection{Inference Rules}
\label{statmod-rules-sec}
As\index{39.1} for the Core, the rules of the Modules static semantics allow
sentences of the form
\[ A\ts\phrase\ra A'\]
to be inferred, where in this case $A$ is either a basis, a context or
an environment and $A'$ is a semantic object.  The convention for options
is as in the Core semantics. 

Although not assumed in our definitions, it is intended that every basis
$\B=\N,\F,\G,\E$ in which a $\topdec$ is elaborated has the property
that $\NamesFcn\F\ \cup$\linebreak$\NamesFcn\G\cup\NamesFcn\E\subseteq\N$. This is not
the case for bases in which signature expressions and specifications are
elaborated, but the following Theorem can be proved:
\begin{quote}
Let S be an inferred sentence $\B\ts\topdec\ra\B'$ in which $\B$ satisfies
the above condition. Then $\B'$ also satisfies the condition.

Moreover, if S$'$ is a sentence of the form
$\B''\ts\phrase\ra A$ occurring in a proof of S, where $\phrase$ is
either a structure expression or a structure-level declaration, then $\B''$
also satisfies the condition.

Finally, if $\T,\U,\E\ts\phrase\ra A$ occurs
in a proof of S, where $\phrase$ is a phrase of the Core, then
$\TyNamesFcn\E\subseteq\T$.

\begin{description}
\item{(\ref{generative-strexp-rule})}
   The side condition ensures that each generative structure
expression receives a new name. If the expression occurs in
a functor body the structure name will be bound by $(\N')$ in
rule~\ref{funbind-rule}; this will ensure that for each application of the 
functor, by rule~\ref{functor-application-rule}, a new distinct name
will be chosen for the structure generated.
%
\item{(\ref{functor-application-rule})}
   The side condition $ (\of{\N}{\B})\cap\N'=\emptyset$  can always
be satisfied by renaming bound names in $(\N')S'$ thus ensuring that the
generated structures receive new names.\index{40.1}

Let $\B(\funid)=(N)(\S_f,(N')\S_f')$. Assuming that $(\N)\S_f$ is
type-explicit, the realisation $\rea$ for which
$\rea(\S_f,(N')\S_f')=(\S'',(\N')\S')$ is uniquely determined by $\S$,
since $\S\succ\S''$ can only hold if the type names and structure
names in $\S$ and $\S''$ agree.  Recall that enrichment $\succ$ allows
more components and more polymorphism, while instantiation $\geq$ does
not.

Sharing between argument and result specified in the declaration of
the functor $\funid$ is represented by the occurrence of the same name
in both $\S_f$ and $\S_f'$, and this repeated occurrence is preserved
by $\rea$, yielding sharing between the argument structure $\S$ and
the result structure $\S'$ of this functor application.
%
\item{(\ref{letstrexp-rule})}
   The use of $\oplus$, here and elsewhere, ensures that structure
and type names generated by
the first sub-phrase
are distinct from names generated by the second
sub-phrase.

The notation $\S\langle'\rangle$ means $\S'$, if the first option is present,
and $\S$ if not.

\item{(\ref{encapsulating-sigexp-rule})}
   In contrast to rule~\ref{generative-strexp-rule}, $m$ is not here 
required to be new. 
The name $m$ may be chosen to achieve the sharing required
in rule~\ref{strshareq-rule}, or to achieve the enrichment side conditions
of rule~\ref{structure-binding-rule} or \ref{funbind-rule}. 
The choice of $m$ must result in an admissible object.
\item{(\ref{signature-identifier-rule})}
   The instance $\S$ of $\B(\sigid)$ is not determined by this rule,
but -- as in rule~\ref{encapsulating-sigexp-rule} -- the instance
may  be chosen to achieve sharing properties or enrichment
conditions.

A signature expression $\sigexp$ which is an immediate constituent of
a structure binding, a signature binding, a functor binding or a
functor signature is elaborated to an equality-principal and type-explicit
signature, see rules \ref{structure-binding-rule}, \ref{sigbind-rule}, 
\ref{funsigexp-rule} and \ref{funbind-rule}.  By contrast, signature 
expressions occurring in structure descriptions are elaborated to
structures using the liberal rules
\ref{encapsulating-sigexp-rule} and \ref{signature-identifier-rule}, 
see rule~\ref{strdesc-rule}, so that names can be chosen to achieve
sharing, when necessary.

Since $\oplus$ is used, any structure name $\m$ and type name $\t$ in

it ensures that further names generated during elaboration of the
body are distinct from $\m$ and $\t$. The set $\N'$ is

\subsection{Functor Signature Matching}
\label{fun-sig-match-sec}
As\index{46} pointed out in Section~\ref{mod-gram-sec} on the 
grammar for Modules, there is no phrase class whose elaboration 
requires matching one functor signature to another functor signature.
But a precise definition of this matching is needed, since a 
functor $g$ may only be separately compiled in the presence of 
specification of any functor $f$ to which $g$ refers, and then a 
real functor $f$ must match this specification.
In the case, then, that $f$ has been specified by a functor signature
\[\funsig_1\ =\ \longfunsig{1}\]
and that later $f$ is declared with functor signature
\[\funsig_2\ =\ \longfunsig{2}\]
the following matching rule will be employed:

A functor signature
$\funsig_2\ =\ \longfunsig{2}$ {\sl matches} another functor signature,
$\funsig_1\ =\ \longfunsig{1}$, if there exists a realisation $\rea$ 
such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\longsig{1}$ matches $\longsig{2}$ via $\rea$, and
\item $\rea((\N_2')\S_2')$ matches $(\N_1')\S_1'$.
\end{enumerate}
The first condition ensures that the real functor signature $\funsig_2$
for $f$ requires the argument $\strexp$ of any application $\f(\strexp)$
to have no more sharing, and no more richness, than was predicted by
the specified signature $\funsig_1$.
The second condition ensures that the real functor signature $\funsig_2$,
instantiated to $(\rea\S_2,\rea((\N_2')\S_2'))$, provides in the result of
the application $\f(\strexp)$
no less sharing, and no less richness, than was predicted by
the specified signature $\funsig_1$.

%We claim that any phrase -- e.g. the declaration of the functor $g$ above --
%which elaborates successfully in a basis $\B$ with $\B(f)=\funsig_1$ will
%also elaborate successfully in the basis $\B+\{f\mapsto\funsig_2\}$.  This
%claim justifies our definition of functor matching.
% -- this claim is false because of open.
